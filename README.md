# [OKBQA-7 Task3 : Multimodal Character Identification on Videos](http://7.okbqa.org/hackathon/task/task3)

## Introduction
The knowledge base is a database that stores the expertise knowledge, rules and facts accumulated from intellectual activities and experiences related to the field in which the AI agent is used for problem solving. The knowledge base is an important element that affects the performance of various application systems based on natural language processing. The typical knowledge bases such as Wikidata, Freebase, WordNet, YAGO, Cyc, and BabelNet are widely used in English.
However, building and maintaining this massive knowledge base manually is very difficult in practice. Therefore, Entity Linking and Discovery (ELD) that can detect entities (people, events, places) from texts of Wikipedia, daily news, and Relation Extraction (RE) that can extract the relationship between the entities are very important technology for automatically expanding a knowledge base (KB Population).
Therefore, in this task, our goal is to develop various models to learn and extract knowledge from the given sentence. Especially, this hackathon is trying to solve the following important problems.
